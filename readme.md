# Welcome to TDS<br> 
## **T**he **D**iscord **S**oundboard 2.X

<br>

Hi, 
this is a small Discord-Soundboard for streaming Sounds/Music into Discord voice channels.
<br>
<br>
In contrast to a 'normal' Soundboard/Soundbot, this application hosts a bot on your local machine for the duration of the playback.
This brings the advantage of an guaranteed availability of the service, combined with the abillity to stream local files from your Harddrive. The latest release enables you, to stream YouTube and several other online-videos into a dicsord voice-channel.
<br>

If you want to re-read the instructions, check out [this](https://github.com/Mayerch1/TheDiscordSoundboard/wiki/Configure-The-Bot) the guide in the wiki ([wiki/Configure-The-Bot.md](https://github.com/Mayerch1/TheDiscordSoundboard/wiki/Configure-The-Bot))

#### How to 'install' the Soundboard

We've got a installer for this application.

You only need to [download](https://github.com/Mayerch1/TheDiscordSoundboard/releases/latest) and execute the install wizard.
Follow all steps and instruction. Everything will be set up correctly.


If you compile the project by yourself, the opus and libsodium dll's won't get generated, so you'll need to download them seperately.

#### How to use the Bot
<br>

To see, how to use the application after it's first startup, have a look at [this](https://github.com/Mayerch1/TheDiscordSoundboard/wiki/First-Startup) wiki page ([wiki/First-Startup](https://github.com/Mayerch1/TheDiscordSoundboard/wiki/First-Startup)).
